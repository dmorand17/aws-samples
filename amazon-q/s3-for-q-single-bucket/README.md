# Enable Amazon Q for Busines for S3

This solution creates the infrastructure to allow Amazon Q for Business to open S3 objects when selected.
The solution leverages an [s3 metadata file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/s3-metadata.html)
to update the S3 object url to reference a CloudFront distribution

- S3 bucket
- CloudFront distribution (uses S3 bucket as origin)
- Lambda function (triggered from Create events on S3 bucket to generate Amazon Q metadata)
